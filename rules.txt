Russian roulette (Russian: русская рулетка, russkaya ruletka) is a potentially deadly game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder,
places the muzzle against the head or body (the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. 
If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, fatally (or seriously) injuring the player.

Russian refers to the supposed country of origin, and roulette to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver's cylinder, similar to a roulette wheel.
